## Usage
  First of all, what is an Activity? Activities are experiences posted by the users about a place they enjoyed, had a good meal, viewed something breathtaking, or just about good hiking in the neighborhood. 
 On the Home page, you will find a brief explanation of the website and a list of activities. In this first contact with the page, you will be able to filter the activities by city or its "tag" which indicates the type of the place (city, nature, lake/beach, art...)
